# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCE_DATA

COMPLETED THIS PROJECT FOR THE INTERNSHIP AT UNP.

Our Power BI dashboard integrates and visualizes financial data to provide in-depth insights into various business metrics. We developed several dashboards focused on key aspects of sales and financial performance, including:

Sales Analysis: Analyzes sales trends, growth, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess revenue performance.

Performance Analysis: Tracks and evaluates team or product performance over time, highlighting areas of success and opportunities for improvement.

COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Analysis: Breaks down the cost structure, helping to identify cost-saving opportunities and margin improvements.

Discount Analysis: Assesses the impact of discounts on sales and profitability, enabling better pricing strategies.
